# VersaBoard




## My own data analysis working environment prototype


**"VersaBoard"** - This name combines the words "versatile" and "board" to convey the idea of a flexible and dynamic platform for tracking project versions and resources. The term "versa" suggests adaptability and multiple possibilities, while "board" represents the visual nature of the web-based dashboards. "VersaBoard" signifies a tool that allows users to easily manage and share project information in a visually engaging and collaborative manner.


Introduction

The purpose of this project is to develop software tools that enable efficient version tracking and resource management for projects. The project includes the creation of web-based dashboards that can be shared with project stakeholders, allowing easy collaboration and showcasing of project progress. The web-based dashboard template supports the display of multiple versions of the dashboard as well as different dashboards and resources associated with the project. By sharing a simple link, project team members and stakeholders can access and collaborate on the project, making the process more streamlined and accessible.


Features

The software tools developed for this project provide the following features:


1. **Version Tracking**: The tools allow tracking and management of different versions of the project's dashboard. Each version represents a specific state of the project and can be accessed individually.


2. **Resource Management**: Resources such as documents, images, datasets, and other project-related files can be associated with the project and managed within the software tools. These resources can be easily accessed and shared through the web-based dashboard.


3. **Web-Based Dashboards**: The project includes the development of web-based dashboards that display project information, progress, and resources. The dashboards are accessible through a link, making it convenient for project collaborators to view and interact with the project's content.


5. **Collaboration and Sharing**: By sharing the link to the web-based dashboard, project team members and stakeholders can easily collaborate on the project. They can access and interact with the dashboard, provide feedback, and contribute to the project's progress.
